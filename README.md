# JS-Puzzle
This is a simple Puzzle made with HTML, Java Script and CSS that I programmed to practice my Java Script.
It's a nice and simple concept and a good excercise for people who are just starting to learn Java Script.

Things that I've implemented:
1.Moving The Parts of the puzzle from one place to a nother.
2.Animating the selection of a puzzle piece.
3.Couter that shows how many turns are left.
4.Scrampling of the pieces each time the page refreshes.
5.Refresh button.

Ideas for further implementations:
1.Better design.
2.Give player the ability to chose his own picture.
3.Give player the ability to chose how complicated the puzzle should be.
4. ...
