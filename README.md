# JS-Puzzle
This is a simple Puzzle made with HTML, Java Script and CSS that I programmed to practice my Java Script.
It's a nice and simple concept and a good excercise for people who are just starting to learn Java Script.

Things that I've implemented:\n
1.Moving The Parts of the puzzle from one place to a nother. \n
2.Animating the selection of a puzzle piece. \n
3.Couter that shows how many turns are left. \n
4.Scrampling of the pieces each time the page refreshes. \n
5.Refresh button. \n

Ideas for further implementations:\n
1.Better design.\n
2.Give player the ability to chose his own picture.\n
3.Give player the ability to chose how complicated the puzzle should be.\n
4. ...
